                <p>At Computer Repairs Pronto we provide local computer repair support for customers in Castle Hill and nearby suburbs. Our workshop is based right here in Castle Hill, which allows us to offer practical turnaround times depending on the issue and parts availability.</p>

                <p>The team have been doing this for over 20 years now. We started back in 2006 and have seen pretty much everything that can go wrong with a computer. Screens, hard drives, logic boards, water damage, viruses, you name it. Castle Hill is home base so most of our work comes from the local area.</p>

                <h2>Why Castle Hill Customers Come to Us</h2>
                <p>Castle Hill has a lot of families with laptops that get dropped or spilled on. A lot of home office setups that have started playing up after a few years. The team at Computer Repairs Pronto have built up a good reputation in the area over the years just by doing the job properly and not overcharging. We are fully insured with public liability and we dont use subcontractors so your machine stays with us the whole time.</p>

                <h2>How We Work</h2>
                <p>When you bring a machine in we have a look at it first and work out what the issue is. We give you a quote before doing any work. If its something simple we can often get it done while you wait or same day. More involved repairs might take a few days depending on what parts are needed. We keep you updated if anything changes.</p>

                <p>All repairs come with a warranty on parts and labour. We use quality parts, genuine where available and quality aftermarket for older machines where thats not an option.</p>

                <h2>Workshop or Onsite</h2>
                <h3>Workshop Repairs</h3>
                <p>Most repairs happen at the workshop. You can drop your machine off Monday to Saturday 8am to 6pm. Easy parking right out front. For laptop repairs and screen replacements the workshop is usually the best option because we have all the tools and parts on hand.</p>

                <h3>Onsite Visits</h3>
                <p>For desktops that are hard to move or network issues that need to be looked at on location we can come to you. Onsite visits suit businesses or home offices where unplugging everything isnt practical. There is a call out fee for onsite work.</p>

                <h2>Common Problems We See in Castle Hill</h2>
                <p>Over the years certain issues come up again and again from Castle Hill customers:</p>
