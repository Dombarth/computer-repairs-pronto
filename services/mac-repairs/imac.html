                <p>At Computer Repairs Pronto we repair iMac desktop computers of all generations. The team have been working on iMacs since the aluminium models came out and have seen the iMac evolve through many iterations. From the early aluminium models with removable glass panels through to the current thin M3 models, we repair all of them. We operate from a <a href="../../hills-district/castle-hill.html" style="color: var(--orange);">workshop near Castle Hill</a> and service customers from across the Hills District.</p>

                <p>The iMac has gone through significant changes over the years. The 2008-2012 models had removable glass panels and were relatively easy to upgrade. The 2012 thin models changed to a laminated display which made things more complex. Then Apple introduced the 5K Retina displays and finally switched to Apple Silicon with the M1 in 2021 and M3 in 2023. Each generation has different considerations for repairs and upgrades. We handle all of them.</p>

                    <h3>iMac Not Working?</h3>
                    <p>Give us a call to discuss your iMac problem. We repair all models and can usually provide a quote over the phone.</p>

                <h2>iMac Models We Repair</h2>
                <p>We repair all iMac models released from 2008 through to the current 2024 models. Below is a comprehensive list organised by generation.</p>

                <h3>iMac 24-inch M3 (2023)</h3>
                <p>The latest iMac with the M3 chip. Available in multiple colours. This model features the thin design introduced with the M1 iMac. Most repairs involve accidental damage or display issues. The M3 chip, RAM and storage are all soldered which limits upgrade options but we can still handle most repairs.</p>
                <ul class="service-list">
                    <li>iMac 24-inch M3 (Late 2023) - Model A2876</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>iMac 24-inch M1 (2021)</h3>
                <p>The first iMac with Apple Silicon featuring a completely new design. Much thinner than previous models and available in seven colours. Common issues include display problems and power issues. The M1 chip, RAM and storage are soldered to the logic board.</p>
                <ul class="service-list">
                    <li>iMac 24-inch M1 (2021) - Model A2438 (8-core GPU)</li>
                    <li>iMac 24-inch M1 (2021) - Model A2439 (7-core GPU)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>iMac 27-inch 5K Retina (2014-2020)</h3>
                <p>The 27-inch Retina iMacs with gorgeous 5K displays. These Intel models were the last user-upgradeable iMacs with a RAM access door on the back. The 2019 and 2020 models can take up to 128GB RAM. Common issues include hard drive failure (great candidates for SSD upgrades), power supply problems, and display issues.</p>
                <ul class="service-list">
                    <li>iMac 27-inch 5K (2020) - Model A2115</li>
                    <li>iMac 27-inch 5K (2019) - Model A2115</li>
                    <li>iMac 27-inch 5K (2017) - Model A1419</li>
                    <li>iMac 27-inch 5K (Late 2015) - Model A1419</li>
                    <li>iMac 27-inch 5K (Mid 2015) - Model A1419</li>
                    <li>iMac 27-inch 5K (Late 2014) - Model A1419</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>iMac 21.5-inch 4K Retina (2015-2019)</h3>
                <p>The smaller Retina iMacs with 4K displays. These do not have user-accessible RAM unlike the 27-inch models. Common issues include slow performance from hard drives (SSD upgrades make a huge difference), and display problems.</p>
                <ul class="service-list">
                    <li>iMac 21.5-inch 4K (2019) - Model A2116</li>
                    <li>iMac 21.5-inch 4K (2017) - Model A1418</li>
                    <li>iMac 21.5-inch 4K (Late 2015) - Model A1418</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>iMac Thin (2012-2017 Non-Retina)</h3>
                <p>The first thin iMac models introduced in late 2012. These models switched to a laminated display assembly which made screen repairs more complex. Many of these still have spinning hard drives which we can upgrade to SSDs for dramatically improved performance.</p>
                <ul class="service-list">
                    <li>iMac 21.5-inch (Mid 2017) - Model A1418</li>
                    <li>iMac 21.5-inch (Late 2015) - Model A1418</li>
                    <li>iMac 21.5-inch (Mid 2014) - Model A1418</li>
                    <li>iMac 21.5-inch (Late 2013) - Model A1418</li>
                    <li>iMac 27-inch (Late 2013) - Model A1419</li>
                    <li>iMac 21.5-inch (Late 2012) - Model A1418</li>
                    <li>iMac 27-inch (Late 2012) - Model A1419</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>iMac Aluminium (2008-2012)</h3>
                <p>The classic aluminium iMacs with the glass front panel. These models are easier to work on than the newer thin models because the glass panel comes off separately from the LCD. RAM is user upgradeable and the hard drive can be replaced. We still see plenty of these for upgrades and repairs.</p>
                <ul class="service-list">
                    <li>iMac 21.5-inch (Mid 2011) - Model A1311</li>
                    <li>iMac 27-inch (Mid 2011) - Model A1312</li>
                    <li>iMac 21.5-inch (Mid 2010) - Model A1311</li>
                    <li>iMac 27-inch (Mid 2010) - Model A1312</li>
                    <li>iMac 21.5-inch (Late 2009) - Model A1311</li>
                    <li>iMac 27-inch (Late 2009) - Model A1312</li>
                    <li>iMac 20-inch (Early 2009) - Model A1224</li>
                    <li>iMac 24-inch (Early 2009) - Model A1225</li>
                    <li>iMac 20-inch (Early 2008) - Model A1224</li>
                    <li>iMac 24-inch (Early 2008) - Model A1225</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Common iMac Repairs</h2>

                <h3>Hard Drive to SSD Upgrades</h3>
                <p>This is one of the most popular iMac upgrades we do. Many older iMacs come with spinning hard drives that get slow over time. Upgrading to an SSD transforms the performance. Boot times go from minutes to seconds. Applications launch instantly. We can clone your existing drive to the new SSD so everything stays the same but faster. On 2012 and later thin models this involves removing the display which requires specialist tools and adhesive.</p>

                <h3>RAM Upgrades</h3>
                <p>On 27-inch iMacs (2012-2020) you can upgrade RAM through the access door on the back. We supply and install RAM upgrades up to 128GB on supported models. On 21.5-inch models and M1/M3 iMacs the RAM is not upgradeable after purchase.</p>

                <h3>Screen Repairs</h3>
                <p>iMac screens can crack, develop lines, or have backlight failure. On 2008-2012 models the glass is separate from the LCD so sometimes just the glass needs replacing. On 2012 and later thin models the display is laminated together so the whole assembly needs replacing. We source quality replacement displays and can usually complete repairs within a few days.</p>

                <h3>Power Supply Issues</h3>
                <p>iMacs that wont turn on or randomly shut down often have power supply problems. This is a common failure point especially on older models. We diagnose power issues and replace power supplies when needed.</p>

                <h3>Graphics Card Issues</h3>
                <p>Some older iMacs (particularly 2009-2011 models) had issues with graphics chips failing. Symptoms include distorted graphics, lines on screen, or no display at all. We can diagnose graphics issues and provide repair options.</p>

                <h3>Logic Board Repairs</h3>
                <p>Logic board failures can be caused by power surges, liquid damage, or component failure. We do component level repairs where possible which can save money compared to full board replacement.</p>

                <h3>Fusion Drive Repairs</h3>
                <p>Some iMacs from 2012-2019 came with Fusion Drives which combine an SSD and hard drive. When the hard drive fails the Fusion Drive can become corrupted. We can repair Fusion Drives or convert them to pure SSD storage.</p>

                <h3>Data Recovery</h3>
                <p>If your iMac hard drive has failed we can often recover your data. This includes <a href="../data-recovery.html" style="color: var(--orange);">data recovery</a> from failed hard drives, corrupted Fusion Drives, and even some failed SSDs.</p>

                <h2>iMac Sizes Over the Years</h2>
                <p>iMacs have been available in various sizes:</p>
                <ul class="service-list">
                    <li><strong>20-inch</strong> - Available 2007-2009</li>
                    <li><strong>21.5-inch</strong> - Available 2009-2019</li>
                    <li><strong>24-inch</strong> - Available 2007-2009 and returned with M1 in 2021</li>
                    <li><strong>27-inch</strong> - Available 2009-2020 (discontinued with Apple Silicon transition)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Bringing Your iMac In</h2>
                <p>iMacs are large and fragile so need to be transported carefully. When bringing your iMac to our workshop:</p>
                <ul class="service-list">
                    <li>Transport it upright if possible, not flat</li>
                    <li>Use the original box if you still have it</li>
                    <li>Protect the screen from scratches and impacts</li>
                    <li>Bring the power cable</li>
                    <li>Write down your password if we need it for testing</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If you cant transport your iMac yourself let us know and we may be able to arrange pickup for customers in the <a href="../../hills-district/" style="color: var(--orange);">Hills District</a>.</p>

                <h2>iMac vs Mac Mini vs Mac Studio</h2>
                <p>Not sure what Apple desktop you have? The iMac is the all-in-one with the screen and computer combined. The Mac Mini is the small box that needs its own monitor. The Mac Studio is the newer performance desktop. We repair all Apple desktops.</p>

                <h2>Turnaround Times</h2>
                <p>Most iMac repairs can be completed within 2-5 days depending on parts availability and complexity. SSD upgrades where we need to remove the display take longer than RAM upgrades on 27-inch models which can be done same day. More complex repairs like logic board work may take longer. We provide an estimated timeframe when you drop off your machine.</p>

                <h2>Warranty on Repairs</h2>
                <p>All iMac repairs come with a warranty on parts and labour. If something goes wrong with the repair we fix it at no additional cost.</p>
