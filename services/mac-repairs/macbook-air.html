                <p>At Computer Repairs Pronto we repair MacBook Air laptops of all generations. The team have been working on MacBook Airs since the original model came out back in 2008 and have seen every issue there is with these machines. We operate from a <a href="../../hills-district/castle-hill.html" style="color: var(--orange);">workshop near Castle Hill</a> and service customers from across the Hills District.</p>

                <p>The MacBook Air has changed significantly over the years. The early models from 2008-2017 were Intel based machines with upgradeable SSDs and in some cases RAM. The 2018-2020 models introduced the T2 chip and soldered components. Then Apple switched to their own M1, M2 and M3 chips from 2020 onwards. We work on all of these generations.</p>

                <div class="contact-box" style="margin: 32px 0;">
                    <h3>MacBook Air Not Working?</h3>
                    <p>Give us a call to discuss your MacBook Air problem. We can usually provide a quote over the phone.</p>

                <h2>MacBook Air Models We Repair</h2>
                <p>We repair all MacBook Air models released from 2008 through to the current 2026 models. Below is a comprehensive list of the models we work on.</p>

                <h3>MacBook Air M3 (2026)</h3>
                <p>The latest MacBook Air with the M3 chip. Available in 13-inch and 15-inch sizes. These are still quite new so most repairs involve accidental damage like cracked screens or liquid spills. The M3 chip and memory are soldered to the logic board which limits some repair options but we can still handle most issues.</p>
                <ul class="service-list">
                    <li>MacBook Air 13-inch M3 (2026) - Model A3113</li>
                    <li>MacBook Air 15-inch M3 (2026) - Model A3114</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>MacBook Air M2 (2022-2023)</h3>
                <p>The redesigned MacBook Air with the M2 chip featuring the new flat-edged design. Available in 13-inch and 15-inch. Common issues include screen damage, keyboard problems and battery degradation after a couple of years of use.</p>
                <ul class="service-list">
                    <li>MacBook Air 13-inch M2 (2022) - Model A2681</li>
                    <li>MacBook Air 15-inch M2 (2023) - Model A2941</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>MacBook Air M1 (2020)</h3>
                <p>The first MacBook Air with Apple Silicon. This model marked a big change from Intel. The M1 chip is significantly faster than the Intel models it replaced. Common repairs include screen replacements, battery replacements and keyboard issues. Still a popular model that we see regularly.</p>
                <ul class="service-list">
                    <li>MacBook Air 13-inch M1 (2020) - Model A2337</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>MacBook Air Retina (2018-2020 Intel)</h3>
                <p>The Intel Retina MacBook Air models introduced the updated design with thinner bezels and Touch ID. These models have the T2 security chip and soldered SSD. Common issues include flexgate display problems, keyboard failures and battery wear.</p>
                <ul class="service-list">
                    <li>MacBook Air 13-inch Retina (Late 2020) - Model A2179</li>
                    <li>MacBook Air 13-inch Retina (2019) - Model A1932</li>
                    <li>MacBook Air 13-inch Retina (2018) - Model A1932</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>MacBook Air (2015-2017)</h3>
                <p>The last of the classic MacBook Air design with the wedge shape and non-Retina display. These models have upgradeable SSDs which makes storage upgrades possible. Still see plenty of these coming in for repairs and upgrades.</p>
                <ul class="service-list">
                    <li>MacBook Air 13-inch (2017) - Model A1466</li>
                    <li>MacBook Air 13-inch (Early 2015) - Model A1466</li>
                    <li>MacBook Air 11-inch (Early 2015) - Model A1465</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>MacBook Air (2012-2014)</h3>
                <p>These models introduced the MagSafe 2 connector and USB 3.0. The 2012 models were the first with the current wedge design. SSDs are upgradeable on these models. We still repair these regularly though parts are becoming harder to source.</p>
                <ul class="service-list">
                    <li>MacBook Air 13-inch (Early 2014) - Model A1466</li>
                    <li>MacBook Air 11-inch (Early 2014) - Model A1465</li>
                    <li>MacBook Air 13-inch (Mid 2013) - Model A1466</li>
                    <li>MacBook Air 11-inch (Mid 2013) - Model A1465</li>
                    <li>MacBook Air 13-inch (Mid 2012) - Model A1466</li>
                    <li>MacBook Air 11-inch (Mid 2012) - Model A1465</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>MacBook Air (2008-2011)</h3>
                <p>The original MacBook Air models including the iconic first generation from 2008. These were groundbreaking at the time for their thin design. Parts are difficult to source for these older models but we can still help with some repairs and data recovery.</p>
                <ul class="service-list">

                <h2>Common MacBook Air Repairs</h2>

                <h3>Screen Replacements</h3>
                <p>Cracked or damaged MacBook Air screens are one of the most common repairs we do. The Retina displays on newer models are particularly prone to damage from pressure on the lid or impacts. We replace complete display assemblies with quality parts. Turnaround is usually same day or next day depending on parts availability.</p>

                <h3>Battery Replacements</h3>
                <p>MacBook Air batteries typically last 3-5 years before they start to degrade significantly. Signs of a worn battery include reduced runtime, slow performance, and the Service Battery warning. We can replace MacBook Air batteries on all models. The battery is glued in on newer models which makes it a bit more involved to replace.</p>

                <h3>Keyboard Repairs</h3>
                <p>The butterfly keyboard on 2018-2020 MacBook Air models was notorious for problems with keys not working or repeating. Apple had a keyboard replacement program for these but that has now ended. We can still repair or replace problematic keyboards. The M1 and later models went back to the scissor switch design which is more reliable.</p>

                <h3>Logic Board Repairs</h3>
                <p>Logic board issues can be caused by liquid damage, power surges, or component failure. We do component level repairs where possible which can save money compared to full board replacement. For liquid damaged boards we clean and assess damage before providing repair options.</p>

                <h3>SSD Upgrades and Data Recovery</h3>
                <p>On older MacBook Air models (2012-2017) we can upgrade the SSD to a larger capacity. This is a great way to extend the life of an older machine. For models with soldered storage we can help with <a href="../data-recovery.html" style="color: var(--orange);">data recovery</a> if the drive has failed.</p>

                <h3>Charging Issues</h3>
                <p>MacBook Airs that wont charge could have issues with the charging port, logic board, or battery. Older models use MagSafe connectors which can wear out. Newer models use USB-C which is generally more reliable but can still have issues. We diagnose charging problems and repair or replace components as needed.</p>

                <h3>Trackpad Repairs</h3>
                <p>MacBook Air trackpads can fail or become unresponsive. On newer models the trackpad uses Force Touch technology. We repair and replace trackpads on all models. Sometimes trackpad issues are caused by a swollen battery pushing up from underneath.</p>

                <h2>MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro</h2>
                <p>Not sure if you have a MacBook Air or <a href="macbook-pro.html" style="color: var(--orange);">MacBook Pro</a>? The Air is the thinner lighter model designed for everyday use. The Pro is thicker with better performance and on recent models has more ports. You can check your model by clicking the Apple menu and selecting About This Mac.</p>

                <h2>Turnaround Times</h2>
                <p>Most MacBook Air repairs can be completed within 1-3 days depending on parts availability. Simple repairs like RAM upgrades on older models or software fixes can often be done same day. More complex repairs like logic board work may take longer. We provide an estimated timeframe when you drop off your machine.</p>

                <h2>Warranty on Repairs</h2>
                <p>All MacBook Air repairs come with a warranty on parts and labour. If something goes wrong with the repair we fix it at no additional cost.</p>
