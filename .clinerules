# Project Rules for Computer Repairs Pronto

## Git Workflow (Quick & Thorough Push)

When committing and pushing changes, always use these commands in sequence:

```powershell
# 1. Stage all changes
git add -A

# 2. Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# 3. Pull remote changes and rebase to avoid conflicts
git pull --rebase

# 4. Push to remote
git push
```

**Important Notes:**
- PowerShell does not support `&&` - run commands separately
- Always `git pull --rebase` before `git push` to avoid non-fast-forward rejections
- If push is rejected, pull with rebase first then push again
